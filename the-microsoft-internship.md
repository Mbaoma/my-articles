Hi there, I am Mbaoma Chioma Mary; I just got an internship offer with Microsoft and this is how it all happened....

I got a mail from Jenn Travis, a Microsoft University recruiter on Tuesday, 1st December, 2020, thanking me for applying to role of a Software Engineer Intern and asking if I was interested in a Program Manager role instead.
Prior to this, I had gotten about 4 rejection mails from Microsoft Nigeria.

I read up about the role and decided to apply because, 'why not?' and mailed Jenn on my decision. At this time, I was struggling with my faulty laptop and had a summit coming up, where I had to give a talk. This was during the Microsoft Africa Students Summit and I later learned that there was recruitment ongoing.

That same day, Jenn mailed me saying I was invited to a first round of interview (mad o!). I informed Olumide Ogundare, Uchenna Jeremiah, Winner Emeto, Ndubuisi Onyemenam, Sodiq Akinjobi, Ifihan Olusheye, Abisola Jegede, Onuoha Maryann, Auwwal and Akinwunmi Aguda because I had zero idea on what to expect from an interview.
Winner was already working with Microsoft and gave me an insight on what the first round entails, basically behavioural questions.

I gathered all the [reading resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TG0xbZJnMru8VZ-UeJiE4_-xMQUgcZ_L1L0tlf2nmOQ/edit?usp=sharing) I could get and started studying them, having mock interviews alongside (also watching other people's mock interviews on Youtube channels such as Exponent, ThatPMGuy etc) and praying a lot too.

Fast forward to the interview week, our transformer got spoilt and our generator was faulty also (chai, village people o!). I charged my devices overnight at a neighbour's house and waited for 3:30pm December 14th, 2020.

My interviewer was Jacquelyn Ekwueme and she was kind and it felt more like a conversation with a friend. My interview went well, I felt I gave a 'wrong answer' to the last question I was asked, and that gave me creeps as I thought that cancelled any prospects of me getting to the next round.

One week, two weeks, the countdown was on and my parents were asking me, 'howfar?'. I continued praying and waiting and when I least expected it, I got a mail inviting me to the second round of the interview, I was so happpyyyyyyy!!!!! (i fell off my chair)

Another hurdle was in front of me, I informed my 'interview crew' and preparations began in earnest. Edet Bassey was very helpful at this stage as our roles had some similarities and he is more experienced (he is a product manager). 

Sadly, I fell ill when my interview date drew near (tears), but I continued studying and praying, hoping for the best.
My interview date came, we had power supply and our generator had been fixed (can't be caught offguard twice); it was a rather exhausting process for me as I was straining my already weak body but I had my family supporting me, so I did my best.

My interviewers were interesting people and they asked me rather intelligent questions and they were also very helpful, answering my questions and explaining the questions they asked. It was rather exciting!

After the interview, I prepared myself to wait for at least another one or two weeks to get a response (as this was what my recruiter Katherine said earlier).
When I got the notification that Katherine Safar sent me a mail, I said 'ahan!', then I checked the heading and saw 'Chioma, Your Microsoft Interview Results!', I said 'aaahhhhhh, so fast?', my heart started racing.
I quickly asked my friends who were also interviewd if they got mails, then I summoned courage and opened the mail, the first paragraph sent me to the ground, I could not believe it, I got the offer!

Yooo! Mama I made it, small child like me!

It has been rather thrilling, I never expected it. This picture was taken in February,2020 at Microsoft Lagos, Nigeria during the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors, Nigeria Summit.

Who would have thought that a few months later, I will be resuming there as an intern.

I am really grateful to everyone who has been supporting me and pray that we all get our heart desires.
